    </section>
    <p> It was baby steps that brought me into the coding world. I had always had a flair for Art and Science. Painting
        wild swirl trees to studying Health Care Administration. It took me a long time to find the right blend of both.
        Enter: the beautiful world of coding. Complex enough to make your head spin, but beautiful enough to bring you
        back one keyboard stroke at a time. </p>
