        <h3>About Me</h3>
    <img src="assets/images/aboutmephoto.JPG">
    <p> Hello there! My name is Catherine, but everyone calls me 'Cat'.  This is a showcase of my front end development, thus far in my coding journey.  It was baby steps that brought me into the coding world. I had always had a flair for Art and Science.  I love to paint, especially trees, and have recieved a BA in Health Care Administration.  So, coding?  Well, there was always soemthing pulling at me to create, and build.  During the pandemic, I fell in love with coding, but I wanted more. I decided to take the plunge and attend the UPenn Full Stack Developer Boot Camp (pending certification November 2021) Coding is a beautiful blend of art, science, and frustration. Complex enough to make your head spin, but beautiful enough to bring you back one keyboard stroke at a time. </p>
