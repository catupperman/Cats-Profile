    <img src="assets/images/aboutmephoto.JPG">
    <p> It was baby steps that brought me into the coding world. I had always had a flair for Art and Science. Painting
        wild, swirling trees in my free time to studying Health Care Administration, in an attempt to start a career.
         When suddenly, I found the right blend of both.
        Enter: the beautiful world of coding. 
        Complex enough to make your head spin, but beautiful enough to bring you
        back one keyboard stroke at a time.</p>
