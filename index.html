            <img id="profile-photo" src="assets/images/aboutmephoto.JPG">
            <p> Hello there! My name is Catherine, but everyone calls me 'Cat'. This is a showcase of my front end
                development, thus far in my coding journey. It was baby steps that brought me into the coding world. I
                had always had a flair for Art and Science. I love to paint, especially trees, and have recieved a BA in
                Health Care Administration. So, coding?
                <br>
                Well, there was always soemthing pulling at me to create, and
                build. During the pandemic, I fell in love with coding, but I wanted more. I decided to take the plunge
                and attend the UPenn Full Stack Developer Boot Camp (pending certification November 2021) Coding is a
                beautiful blend of art, science, and frustration. Complex enough to make your head spin, but beautiful
                enough to bring you back one keyboard stroke at a time. </p>
