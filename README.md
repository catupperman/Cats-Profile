# Cats-Profile

## **Start from Scratch**
This was a build from scratch HTML and CSS project, that will carry through the rest of my career.  This is my second major edit to this page, and the last hands on was about a month.  I never realized how much I had learned until noodling around with this page.  

## **The Work**
This go around I wanted to try a new technique that we had not touched on in classes.  The Grid, after listening to podcasts and watching tutorials, I was able to apply what I learned to the page.  I liked working with the Grid and can see the advantages, if I have to work with it again in the future. This time around, I also attempted to work with @media queries instead of leaning on flex, as my page had before. I have ideas for the future, and some JavaScript I'd like to incorporate.
