**Start from Scratch**
This was a build from scratch HTML and CSS project, that will carry through the rest of my career.  In order to show what kind of developer you are, what better way then to build it. Starting with HTML, learning the emmet abreviation was critical, having that as a jumping off point to add to the basic frame work, was a huge time saver,  (Not to mention, nice to learn a new term!). Building the CSS was a little more difficult, as it doesn't come with a jumping off point. 

**The Work**
I spent a lot of time manipulating images and trying to have it appear the way I wanted to one the screen, especially when changing what platform a potential user might be on.  Tricky, but very rewarding when achieving the goal.  Flex has become a better friend of mine, not best friend, but a close one. This was a great learning experience, and I look forward to altering this website as I progress. A big take away I've learned from this. - Never write code you would be upset deleting later.![IMG_0120](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84750356/122148978-55005c00-ce29-11eb-9c03-5f98cd17231a.jpeg)
